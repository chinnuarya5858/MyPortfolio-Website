                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Arya Kunjumon — a passionate software developer and ducator with a strong interest in building web applications using Python and Django. I'm certified in back-end development by Meta and have gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and the basics of Java and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked as an English Language Trainer at Kiddiebus, where I blend my love for teaching with my technical skills. I was honored as the Star Trainer of the Month within six months of joining. I’ve also contributed as a Talent Acquisition Specialist, sharpening my skills in communication, collaboration, and hiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm especially interested in Django development, generative AI, and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. I aspire to work abroad and continue growing in both the development and education fields.
                </p>
